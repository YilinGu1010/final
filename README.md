# Unsupervised Mapping of Earthquake-Triggered Landslides from Sentinel-2 Imagery

This project employs unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to identify landslide scars triggered by an earthquake. The infographic below outlines the overall workflow of the project.

## About the project

This project serves as the final assignment for GEOL0069: Artificial Intelligence for Earth Observation. It investigates the application of unsupervised learning techniques—namely K-means clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)—to detect landslide scars using pre- and post-earthquake Sentinel-2 optical imagery. The full code implementation can be found in the notebook titled AI4EO_Final_Project.ipynb.
